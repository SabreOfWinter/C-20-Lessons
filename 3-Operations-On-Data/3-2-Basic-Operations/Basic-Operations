Integer divison will not result in a fractional number, instead splitting the number and keeping the whole number on the left of the decimal place

 Example: 31 / 10 = 3 (10 | 10 | 10 | 1)

The Modulus operation will provide the remainder from dividing two numbers

 Example: 31 / 10 = 1 (10 | 10 | 10 | 1)
