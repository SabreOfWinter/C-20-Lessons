A set of rules that we can follow to know what to do when we have multiple operations in the same expression
 - Without a clear idea of the order to perform operations, it could lead to different possible 	results

a + b * c -d/e -f + g

In C++
 - Multiplication and Divison come before Addition and Subtraction

Precedence : 	Which operations to do first
Associativity : Which direction or which order

C++ Operator precedence table available to show the order of operations and their associativity

- It is better to make the intent in your code as clear as possible  by clearly using () to indicate which operations you want done first
