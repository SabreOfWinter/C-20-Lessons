Booleans 
 - Can store one of two possible states (True or False)
 - Used mostly for decision making in programs
 - In memory they take up 8 bits
 - A byte can store 256 different values
 - Using it just to cover two states (True/False) is wasteful, especially for devices with hard memory constraints (think embedded devices)
 - There are techniques to pack even more data into a byte.
