Fractional Numbers (aka Floating Point Types)
 - Used to represent numbers with fractional parts in C++

Type 		Size	Precision	Comment
-----------------------------------------------------------
float		4	7		-
double		8	15		Recommended default
long double	12	> double

Precision
 - The number of bits that can be represented that type, starting from the first number before the 	decimal place

Differences with int data type
 - Can divide by zero
	n(floating point)/0 | Infinity(+/-)
 - Can divide 2 floating point numbers that are 0
	0.0/0.0 | NaN (Not a Number)
  	

- Remember the suffixes when initializing floating point variables, otherwise the default will be 	double
- Double works well in many situations, so you will see it used a lot
